This project presents a set of data visualizations created using Power BI as part of Task 2 of the Elevate Lab internship. The visual report (Task2_visualization.pdf) contains multiple charts that analyze sales, profit, quantity, discount patterns, and regional performance. The visuals include: a bar chart showing the Count of Sales by Category across Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology; a Count of Sales by City chart highlighting high-demand cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Seattle; an Average Profit by Quantity line chart that helps understand profitability trends with increasing quantity; and a Sum of Profit by City bar chart indicating which cities contribute the most profit. The report also includes regional analyses such as the Sum of Sales by Region and Sum of Profit by Region, comparing performance across West, East, Central, and South regions. Additional visuals like the Sum of Quantity by City and Count of Discounts by Category provide deeper insights into customer buying patterns and discount usage across product categories. Overall, this visualization file gives a clear summary of how sales and profit vary by product category, city, and region, helping in understanding business performance and trends.
